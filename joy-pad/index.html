  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>Joy Pad was an idea inspired by Penny Arcade, a popular web comic series. My brother and I decided to put our artistic, comedic and technical talents together. Our goal was to deliver insightful critique, and provide general feedback about video games from our small niche in the world. I unfortunately realized that I do not have the time to maintain and play video games as much as I did as a kid, and the site was abandoned as soon as it was published. Perhaps when I finish school the site will be revived shortly.</p>
  <p>
  This is first dive into the world of CMS (namely WordPress), HTML5, CSS3, and PHP/MySQL scripting. Since I'm not a "web designer" by trade, most of the site's styling was "borrowed" from <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com">Penny Arcade</a>, an infamous web comic. In terms of design, many of the assets were heavily modified and most of the site code was rewritten for WordPress. Some of these intricate functionalities include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a>Custom blog banner for distinguishing who is writing content</a></li>
      <li><a>RSS Feeder</a></li>
      <li><a>Custom Font</a></li>
      <li><a>Comic navigation</a></li>
      <li><a>Blog navigation</a></li>
    </ul>
