		<p>This website is not functioning properly, unfortunately. I have to figure out a safe way to allow image uploading as I keep having bots from Russia and China abuse this site. So for now, it is disabled. However, feel free to look at the source code for this site and my functions at <a href="http://www.github.com/s37syed/toronto-comedy">GitHub.</a></p>
		<p> Welcome to the TorCom page! It's where you can upload your own comedy and distribute it amongst people in Toronto! To see a user guide on how to use this website, click here: <a href="/toronto-comedy/user_guide.pdf">Toronto-Comedy User Guide.</a></p>
